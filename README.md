# **README — WorldEdit Command Generator (W.I.P.)**

## **Overview**

The **WorldEdit Command Generator** is a work-in-progress web tool designed to make creating complex `//replace` commands faster, easier, and more intuitive.
Instead of manually typing long block lists and patterns, users can generate commands through a simple visual interface.

## **Features (Current & Planned)**

### ✅ **Current**

* Interactive UI for entering block types
* Real-time preview of the generated `//replace` command
* Error detection for invalid inputs
* Clean, modern interface

### 🔧 **Planned**

* Autocomplete for block IDs
* Built-in block palette
* Generate commands for multiple WorldEdit tools (not just `//replace`)
* Presets for commonly used replace combinations
* Export/Import settings
* Dark/Light mode options

## **Why This Tool Exists**

WorldEdit is powerful, but typing long and complex commands—especially repetitive replace operations—quickly becomes tedious.
This tool removes friction, lowers the chance of errors, and speeds up workflow for builders and server staff.

## **Status**

This project is currently **in development (W.I.P.)**.
Expect visual changes, new features, and improvements frequently.

# **README — EffectMaster Show Sequencer (W.I.P.)**

## **Overview**

The **EffectMaster Show Sequencer** is a W.I.P. tool created to streamline the creation, organization, and timing of effects for **EffectMaster** (Minecraft effect/particle system).
It allows creators to build shows, sequences, and timelines without editing JSON or commands manually.

## **Features (Current & Planned)**

### ✅ **Current**

* Basic timeline editor for sequencing effects
* Visual effect arrangement and ordering
* Adjustable delays and timings
* Export sequence to EffectMaster-compatible format

### 🔧 **Planned**

* Drag-and-drop timeline interface
* Multi-track layering (e.g., particles, sounds, lights)
* Live preview/simulation support
* Effect templates and presets
* Import existing EffectMaster shows
* Collaboration/sharing features

## **Use Cases**

* Creating firework-style shows
* Choreographing particle sequences
* Timing effects with rides, events, or story moments
* Server team collaboration on advanced show systems

## **Goal**

To make complex effect sequencing **simple, visual, and intuitive**—removing the need for manual timing calculations or trial-and-error with in-game commands.

## **Status**

Active development.
Several core features are experimental and subject to change.
